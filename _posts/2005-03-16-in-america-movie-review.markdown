A sweetly sentimental story of the unlikely friendship between two Irish immigrant girls in New York with a black artist dying of aids while their poverty stricken parents lose another baby. Utter rubbish. When are we going to see something from the Irish that doesn&rsquo;t involve terrorism or poverty?<br/>
 Some scenes are pure poetry though. They should have shot the writers before the film. This film should have been shot start to finish as a fifteen (make that five) minute montage with no dialogue, because that&rsquo;s how badly the story lets down an otherwise excellent crew. Well, atleast some struggling English actors might get a shot at Hollywood stardom because of this film. It certainly wasn&rsquo;t good for anything else. 

Note to self. Don&rsquo;t watch any other movies by Jim Sheridan.
