<b>Update:</b> Apparently the ending is more or less as it is in the book. The author, Daniel Wallace, makes a cameo as the economics professer at Auburn.<br/>

So I figure there are enough reviews on the net, so I&rsquo;ll keep this one short. At first I thought this was one of those movies that Anoop likes. Then it got better. And better and better. This movie is awesome.

Hollywood endings piss me off though. They&rsquo;re written by market researchers. It&rsquo;s almost censorship! When Billy Crudup starts telling the last story I was torn between the intense emotion of the previous scene and the totally crappy story he tells. All the people are there?? What rubbish. Otherwise spectacular.
