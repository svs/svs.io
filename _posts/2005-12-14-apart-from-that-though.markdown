<p>&hellip;the weekend was a resounding success. A dream came true. I met someone with the same name as I. I met someone I&rsquo;m connected to in perfect synchronicity and when she sang, she left me reeling, unbalanced, my soul trying to find its feet and right itself within this new perspective. She revealed me, stripped me naked to the core in a four line verse more beautiful than life itself. She threw a switch in my head that day and all the lights came on and everything was suddenly clear. </p>

<p>I believe she sang to me.</p>
