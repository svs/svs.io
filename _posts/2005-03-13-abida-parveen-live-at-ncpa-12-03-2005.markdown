<p>So I figure that Nusrat was truly a God, because Abida - who is clearly the second most famous sufi singer alive today - doesn&rsquo;t even manage to come close.</p>

<p>Having said that, let me also say that I probably entered the concert with certain misconceptions abour what I was going to see. I remembered Nusrat&rsquo;s singing as having a strong classical base and an ample amount of improvisation, and so I figured Abida would be more of the same. However, although she has a phenomenal voice and she sings with passion, her entire performance was far more folky than I had anticipated. Once I&rsquo;d internalised this fact, the concert went much better from there on. Abida and her band were musically monotonous, so much so that even her acclaimed voice couldn&rsquo;t lift the performance to any sort of greatness. </p>

<p>It took me the whole of the first set to recognise the modalities of the concert. Like a blues song, Abida would pick her couplets at whim, sing them and then come back to the refrain over and over, almost trance like. The lyrics that I understood were phenomenal, and so once I&rsquo;d settled back to think of it as a poetry recital rather than a musical concert, things went much better.</p>

<p>Musically though, the concert was a disappointment. None of her accompanists got a chance to show off their skill. Abida sang one scale the whole evening.</p>

<p>None of this is meant to be disparaging though. Perhaps (very likely) I&rsquo;m totally ignorant about the Sufi musical forms and what Parveen did was probably exactly what she has won so much acclaim for. It&rsquo;s probably just me.</p>
