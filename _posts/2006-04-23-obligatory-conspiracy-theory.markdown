<p>Twice in six months? Sure sounds fishy to me&hellip;.is someone trying to assasinate him? Who could it be? And for what earthly reason? At around the time of the <a href="http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20021229/biz1.jpg" target="_blank">Reliance</a> Petroleum (that word again!) IPO? Could his brother be some sort of scapegoat in some bizarre high powered game of oil, share dealings and power? Does the <a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/nov/03sld4.htm" target="_blank">Shivani Bhatnagar</a> episode imply a pattern, a <i>modus operandi</i>? Is the brother mentally ill or not?</p>
