<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0210727/" target="_blank">Himalaya</a> is a breathtakingly beautiful film, and that&rsquo;s just the start of it. The cinematography is exquisite and some of the shots are truly stunning. How ever did they film some of those shots? I suppose with such breathtaking scenery, it would be pretty hard to make an ugly film. Even so, this is one beautiful film. Although his IMDB credits are quite slim, director <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0885108/" target="_blank">Eric Valli</a> clearly knows what he&rsquo;s doing with the pace of this film. He&rsquo;s taken his time with the shots, letting the movie sink into you. The writing is great, very understated and mellow. A cast of mainly non-actors delivers a Bollywood-shaming masterclass in restraint and expression although since they&rsquo;re speaking a language I don&rsquo;t understand, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m sure about this :-).

What I loved most about this film was the way (for the most part) each scene said what it said without having to say what it said. The storyline isn&rsquo;t great though. The &ldquo;demons path&rdquo; device and the fully-resolved ending kind of turned me off a little bit, but then one can&rsquo;t always have everything.
