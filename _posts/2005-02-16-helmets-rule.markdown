<p>Although the controversy regarding the &ldquo;making compulsory of helmets&rdquo; seems to have died down, it&rsquo;s but a matter of time before it rears its ugly head again. (Baba, te tumhi helmets compulsory karnaar hota, tyacha kaay jhala? Majhi factory ashich padleli aahe.) Before it does so, let me explain to you why it is utterly unreasonable to make helmets compulsory.<br/>
 First of all, if one is wearing a helmet, how is one supposed to talk on a mobile phone while riding. After all, its far too dangerous to remove ones helmet, reach into one&rsquo;s pant pocket or purse, then pull out the phone, see who&rsquo;s calling and finally answer the phone. No, helmets would make this action far too dangerous and cannot therefore be made compulsory. In the interest of the health and safety of the public.<br/>
 Secondly, Puneites have this curious strain of spondilitis which makes it impossible to turn the head and look before driving onto a main road. This is an aggresively degenerating disease and is usually fatal. Adding the burden of a helmet onto what is already a broken back is not only immoral, it is inhuman.<br/>
 To compensate for this curse of nature, Puneites have developed a keen corner-eye vision. Squid-like, they claim they can see everything even though they never seem to move their heads around, which brings us to our next point. A helmet restricts the field of vision. Will you take away one of the last lines of defence that the poor driver has against Pune&rsquo;s traffic mayhem?<br/>
 After all, these are grown-up responsible adults we&rsquo;re talking about. The state should not and can not treat them like little children who don&rsquo;t know whats good for them.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s all I have to say about that.</p>
