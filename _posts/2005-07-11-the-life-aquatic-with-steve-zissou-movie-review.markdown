Funky title, funky film, boring as hell. Like watching a Hyundai Santro with &ldquo;Racing America&rdquo; stickers and a rear spoiler chunder down the expressway at 65 kmph.</p>

<p>Wes Anderson has made a career out of &lsquo;quirky&rsquo;, and while in a perfect world there should be space for a voice like this, I&rsquo;d be far happier I think, if he found something coherent to say, or even a coherent way of saying whatever it is that he wants to.</p>

<p>Style is one thing, substance is another - any MBA (or post-modernist) will tell you that. If Wes&rsquo;d been a corporate executive, he&rsquo;d probably be responsible for Vanilla Coke. Good for Owen Wilson though, he&rsquo;s managed to overcome the handicap of his nose, which can only be a good thing.</p>

<p>And this isn&rsquo;t just because I used to idolise Cousteau. I even know not just his his middle name (Yves) but also how it is pronounced.</p>
