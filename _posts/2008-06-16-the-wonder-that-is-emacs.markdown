<p>This post is for all you people in Linuxland who stare enviously (and furtively) at  Mac users with their TextMate. I know you&rsquo;ve seen all the screencasts with some geek with a MacBook and TextMate doing their nifty snippet things and going clickety clack on their white keyboards. Well, I know I have and I said, yeah emacs is cool and all but why can&rsquo;t I have some TextMate coolness? Then I remembered, what the fuck? this is emacs we&rsquo;re talking about. A quick search reveals that emacs has had html-helper-mode (i.e. snippets) from 19-fucking-95 when html was a baby. Even cooler? It was written by Marc Andreesen. A whole load of history to go with your editing too.</p>

<p>Here are some good blogs to setup your emacs properly with python code-completion, etc. </p>

Don&rsquo;t forget the <a href="http://platypope.org/yada/emacs-demo/" target="_blank">screencast</a>. That one is from 2006.</p>

<p>Does TextMate do subversion? No, I mean properly&hellip;.</p>
