<p>I am speechless. I laughed so hard I started crying and then at some point, I started to cry for real. When Om Puri says &ldquo;&hellip;to not be scared of cancer&hellip;.&rdquo; </p>

<p>I saw it again immediately, just to be sure.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m not going to complain about happy endings.</p>
