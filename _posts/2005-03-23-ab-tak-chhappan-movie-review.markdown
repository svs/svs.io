Good film. The story isn&rsquo;t that great but atleast here you have a director and an actor that understand the value of silence. Nana Patekar is Nana Patekar as usual. I have yet to see Nana in a role other than that of a slightly mad, junoon-chadha-hua character, but then I&rsquo;m not complaining because he really knows how to play that well.<br/>
 The film, while being gripping, isn&rsquo;t extraordinary. There are some wonderful scenes like the one where he&rsquo;s talking to the gangster while dropping his wife off. Dialogue was good, action was slick. No complaints. Ending was acceptable.

No complaints.
