<p><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0340377/" target="_blank">The Station Agent</a>: A mostly pointless film which has little to say but says it well. The character of Finn is quite stereotypical but well protrayed. The other two characters are awful and a little bit unimaginative, so much so that one is thankful when they aren&rsquo;t around on screen. While this might be the kind of film some people enjoy, I didn&rsquo;t particularly fancy it. Watching &ldquo;an unikely friendship between three troubled individuals&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t my idea of good cinema. The writing was inconsistent, so I have to admit it was brilliant in parts but somehow falls short in the end. Cinematography was slick but unimaginative. An uninspired film, but a worthy attempt.</p>
