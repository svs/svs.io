Just in case you&rsquo;re wondering how I manage to say nice things almost always about the books I read, I just wanted to clarify that I don&rsquo;t write reviews about books I hated. Even so, here&rsquo;s a short list:

The Tin Drum by Gunter Grass - too dense.<br/>
The English Teacher by RK Narayan - terribly slow and boring<br/>
Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert Heinlein - just generally shit. bad writing.<br/>
The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemmingway - style out of date and no fun anymore.
