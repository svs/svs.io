<p>After years of pandering to the inner geek and running various short-lived blogs using first <a href="http://github.com/svs/blu.rb" target="_blank">blurb</a>  and later octopress, I finally decided to bite the bullet and move to tumblr. Heck, all my data belongs to major corporations in any case and of late I&rsquo;ve been feeling more social (perhaps my newfound unemployment has something to do with that)</p>

<p>If you are suffering at the hands of the technologically sophisticated interface at nic.io and can&rsquo;t quite figure out how to set an A record there, use <a href="http://zerigo.com" target="_blank">Zerigo&rsquo;s free plan</a>.</p>
