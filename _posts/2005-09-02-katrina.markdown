I cannot believe what I am seeing on the television. This is the response of the world&rsquo;s most powerful country to an anticipated natural disaster in a major city? Appalling. In India, where some place or the other gets flooded every year, we are well used to seeing footage of planes and helicopters air-dropping food, water and sundry relief materials. Never have I seen the army with guns, police with guns, refugees with guns like in New Orleans. The administration says &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; is priority number one. People are being asked to board up their houses against looters. And why are all the people we see all black?<br/>
 This is a major disaster. I cannot believe it. From the coverage, America sure seems like a spiritual wasteland. Where you expect to hear words like &ldquo;relief&rdquo;, &ldquo;aid&rdquo;, &ldquo;medical supplies&rdquo;, we hear &ldquo;snipers&rdquo;, &ldquo;firefight&rdquo;, &ldquo;security systems&rdquo;. Hell on earth.
