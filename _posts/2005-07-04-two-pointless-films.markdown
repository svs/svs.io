&hellip;and on the same day too!</p>

<p>The first was a French film called &ldquo;A Very Long Engagement&rdquo; about a girl (Audrey Tatou from Amelie) who goes looking for her fiance, presumed dead during the first world war. As a take on the suffering of the common man during war time, it was lukewarm and bearable. On all other counts, it fared pretty poorly. I&rsquo;m getting a bit tired of this too-clever-by-half movie making.</p>

<p>The second was About Schmidt, which had a far deeper message but dragged from start to finish and said what it had to very inelegantly. This is the movie Alexander Payne made before &lsquo;Sideways&rsquo;, so atleast he&rsquo;s going in the right direction.</p>

<p>Did I mention that 'Sideways&rsquo; was just wonderful?</p>
