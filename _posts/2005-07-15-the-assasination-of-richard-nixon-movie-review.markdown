Ah well, another day another movie.

I have a friend who would call this movie subversive not because the protagonist tries to kill richard Nixon, but because the protagonist fails. She says that movies like this are the ones that prop up the system. They lead you to believe that they&rsquo;re against the system but really, they are just all about how you cannot beat it. She&rsquo;s right as well.

In the end, one has neither sympathy for Sam Bicke nor his cause, driven as it is by rage rather than any moral stance. Who wants to support a total loser, even when his cause is to kill the president of the United States. A political film with superficial politics and superior production. That&rsquo;s all. Give this one a miss.
