title: It Leads To This - Album Review
---


Some weeks ago, [@oolhas](https://x.com/oolhaas) referred in passing to this band at some Mumbai tech do. In fact he was telling me that he'd installed a drumset in his office and when I suggested that we should get a band together he said 'yeah let's play some pineapple thief'. 

I was like wtf is a pineapple thief and why does their name sound like they're a porcupine tree spoof band? I got my answer soon enough.

The last album to play on loop for weeks on end in my house was Fear of a Blank Planet. There's something about the Stephen Wilson school of songwriting and the Gavin Harrison school of drumming (he's drummer in both bands) that just makes things so.....so.....lush? Luxurious? You feel pampered listening to both these bands - like the music will never run out. That there's restraint in the songwriting not due to the limitations of the songwriter, but you dear listener would not be able to take it.

Pineapple Thief is nowhere near as ostentatious as Porcupine Tree, but the clarity of musical expression, the authenticity of the yearning, the coherence of the vibe - kadak ekdam.

I've never been one to write album reviews as song by song breakdowns and now at this age I have trouble remembering names but here goes. The songwriting is, as mentioned before, sophisticated. High-brow even. The songs are all five minutes each but feel packed with as much music as a nine minute Dream Theater song. There isn't much blatant virtuosity on display. The funny thing is that this PT depends as much on whole band vibe as Coldplay. The harmonies are spot on - the melodies are simple and they reinforce the logic of the harmonic progression, which is more often than not very sophisticated.
