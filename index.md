Hello, I'm Siddharth Sharma (svs). I'm a technologist who specialises in organisational design and psychology. Currently I express this through my recruiting company [recruit.svs.io](https://recruit.svs.io) and my engineering management consultancy newsletter [engineeringorg.com](https://engineeringorg.com)


You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_svs_) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddharth-sharma-7941a611/). And I run a nerd-focussed Discord Community. Ping me for an invite.

### writing

I write a newsletter on engineering management at
[The engineering org](https://engineeringorg.com)

I am also one of the world's leading experts on the [art of the sabbatical](https://sabbaticalhandbook.com) -- leveraging the power of time off to build the career of your dreams -- and I am writing a book about it. You can read the published chapters here: [sabbaticalhandbook.com](https://sabbaticalhandbook.com)

A few years ago I had an epiphany. I vibe about my world view after the epiphany on a more personal blog ~> [Now. Here. This.](https://nowherethis.svs.io).

And if you must know about my formative years then there's an oooold blog [here](https://blog.svs.io)

### talks   
I talk. A lot. You can see some of my talks on the [talks](/talks.html) page. Here's the latest

### what am I doing now?

I finished my sabbatical and I started a recruiting company. You can say I found my Ikigai.

<s>I'm on sabbatical!-

Sabbaticals are a powerful ~~career~~ life management hack. I'm on my third sabbatical and [am writing a book on it](https://sabbaticalhandbook.com).</s>

### My sankalpa?

I want to move people with words. The elegance of type against paper, the sheer minimalism of it, the leverage it gets from the imagination, the power to mix emotions in the reader, like cooking! I want my words to do this, to change lives.
